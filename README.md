# OopWinformsDesigner
Windows Forms designer using components inherited from DevExpress 19.2.5. The development does not include any Designer from their assemblies, so all the code is intended to be used in code, not in the designer.

The goal of this tool is to implement the complete Designer as it should work from the beginning with this toolkit. 
This tool is compatible with the .NET Framework (4.7.2 and above) and .NET Core (3.0 and above).

I decided to write this tool to help in designing your applications Out Of Process of Visual Studio (2017 / 2019) without being 
annoyed by the crash of your main UI designer.

This version is still under development and any ideas that could help me in develop this application (such as a .Nuget package / VS extension) would be appreciated if you are interested.
